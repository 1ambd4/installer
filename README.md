## Repository Consolidation

Going forward, the .NET SDK team is using the [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk) repository for further development and respond to issues formerly in this repository.

For finding the latest installers table and other installation information, see the [Installing the SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk#installing-the-sdk) section in that repository's readme.
