## Repository Consolidation

Going forward, the .NET SDK team is using the [dotnet/sdk](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk) repository for further development and respond to issues formerly in this repository.

The installers-and-binaries table can be found in [there](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/main/documentation/package-table#table) as well.
